/*
This is a license verification system that checks if the software has a valid purchase license from bdtask.com.

The code:
1. Validates purchase keys against bdtask.com's license server
2. Checks if the software is being run on an authorized domain
3. Enforces license expiration dates
4. Shows a license input form if the license is invalid/expired

If you disable this code:
1. The license verification will be bypassed
2. The software will run without checking purchase validation
3. You may be violating the software's terms of use/license agreement
4. You won't get official updates and support from bdtask.com

The code appears to be part of a commercial licensing system. Disabling it may be against the terms of use,
so it's recommended to maintain a valid license if you're using the software commercially.
